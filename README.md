# Elm Shopping List

This is an attempt to make a shopping list Elm app both for personal use and to demonstrate my skills.

Its current theme illustrates my skills but looks far from ideal, so this repository may remain incomplete
while a future fork may benefit from a revamped, simpler look and feel.

The key lesson is: Glassmorphism-based themes are best reserved for widgets that temporarily cover something of interest in the background.

You can find the Elm Book catalog at [https://marc-llop-elm-shopping-list.netlify.app/elmbook.html](https://marc-llop-elm-shopping-list.netlify.app/elmbook.html),
